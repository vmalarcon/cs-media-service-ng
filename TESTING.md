## Unit Tests
We are using JUnit to write our unit tests. They are run by Maven at `test` phase.

## Integration Tests
We are using JUnit with Spring runner to write our integration tests. They are run by Maven at `verify` phase.

## Ad Hoc Testing
We are using Swagger UI deployed along the service to run ad hoc test on the service. Visit the service endpoint 
(found [here](README.md#environments)) to use Swagger UI.
